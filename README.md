I am a final-year student in the masterâ€™s in Experimental Physics at Utrecht University, working on my thesis on early warning for gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star coalescence using machine learning in field programmable gate arrays. I have strong communication, organisational and problem-solving skills. I am well-versed in data analysis and programming. My earlier academic work was focused on Optics and Quantum Phenomena in the lab and programming and data collection resorting to microcontrollers in my Engineering-based classes, culminating in an Optical System Design bachelor's graduation project.
