I am an Experimental Physics student with strong communication, organizational and problem-solving skills. I am well-versed in data analysis and programming. Most of my latest academic work has been focused on Optics and Quantum Phenomena in the lab and programming and data collection resorting to microcontrollers in my Engineering-based classes, culminating in an Optical System Design graduation project.
